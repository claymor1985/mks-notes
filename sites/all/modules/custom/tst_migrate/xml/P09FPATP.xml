			&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			Introduction:&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;div class=&quot;generalinfo&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This course has been developed to meet the needs of graduates worldwide seeking to gain greater knowledge and experience of the air transport industry, and looking to progress into senior roles in management, operations and commercial planning of airlines, airports, government departments and aviation-related businesses such as aircraft manufacturing, finance and consultancy. It is designed to provide a strong theoretical and analytical basis, coupled with the application of many practical techniques and strategies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The course builds on the successful series of aviation short courses that have attracted participants from around the globe to the University each year. The Department of Transport Studies has a long established interest in air transport research, consultancy and teaching, having been set up by the renowned aviation academic Professor Rigas Doganis some 40 years ago. The University&apos;s association with aviation goes back much further however, as it was here in the 19th century that Sir George Cayley first demonstrated the principles of flight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Modules are taught in blocks of five days at a time to enable international participants to travel efficiently to London several times a year. Students take six taught modules in total (over one year on the full-time course, or two to three years on the part-time course) and complete a research dissertation. Email contact and tutorial support is provided between the module blocks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Modules can also be taken as short courses which are not formally assessed. Students who have followed the relevant short course(s) within the last five years may be able to register at a reduced fee to complete the module on an &apos;assessment only&apos; basis as part of the Masters degree. For more information on these short courses visit westminster.ac.uk/airtransportshort&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course leader&lt;/strong&gt;: Dr Nigel Dennis&lt;br /&gt;E: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:dennisn@westminster.ac.uk&quot;&gt;dennisn@westminster.ac.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			About the course:&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;div class=&quot;coursecontent&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Core modules&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Air Transport Economics&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This module examines the structure of the airline industry and the international regulatory regime within which it operates. You will analyse airline costs and revenues, relating them to financial performance, and examine airport economics along with key concepts in airport operations and planning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Air Transport Forecasting and Market Research&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Through this module you will consider methods for analysing air traffic, forecasting the demand for air services and modelling the pattern of future airline operations. Market research techniques are explained, including questionnaire design and interpretation of survey data. You will discuss key sources of secondary data, and assess elasticities of demand. You will also examine the management of capacity in the context of both airport and airline planning, and develop models of passenger choice and airport attractiveness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Air Transport Management and Operations&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This module develops techniques for optimising the airline and airport product. These are based upon strategic management thinking and an understanding of the nature of demand for air travel. This then leads to the detail of scheduling airline operations, choosing the right aircraft, designing appropriate product features and assessing quality of service. Air cargo has differing requirements to passenger traffic and forms a special analysis. An introduction to air traffic management and the use of airspace is included, as well as some insights to human resources management and industrial relations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Research Dissertation&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This module gives you an opportunity to undertake in-depth research on an air transport topic of your choice, and present analysis, conclusions and recommendations in a written report. It allows you to develop an understanding of all stages of the research process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Option modules*&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Choose one from the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Air Transport Policy and Planning&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This module considers the wider consequences of air services from economic, social and environmental viewpoints. Economic development, accessibility and connectivity are explored, as well as environmental airport capacity and carbon management. You will examine policy issues to encourage sustainable development, land use planning, and the influence of air cargo operations. Surface access policies and the role that they can play in reducing airport environmental impacts are also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Airline Marketing and Business Models&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This module examines airline marketing strategies including advertising media and messages, the distribution of the airline product, customer loyalty schemes and brand management. Methods for route development analysis are developed, and the role of airline alliances to network carriers is discussed. Specialised business models are studied in detail including low-cost airlines, regional carriers, long-haul operators and the charter/inclusive-tour sector of the industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Airport Finance and Strategy&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This module considers how airport management has changed for many operators with adoption of commercialisation, privatisation and internationalisation strategies. Taking these trends into account, you will explore airport financial performance and the factors affecting this. You will also investigate aeronautical charges and the role of competition and regulation, and examine non-aeronautical revenues and strategies to optimise these. This leads to a discussion of different management approaches related to both aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenue streams and different customers, such as low cost carriers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;*As an alternative to one of the above option modules, students have a free choice of one appropriate module from elsewhere in the University (eg transport, logistics, tourism, business). This must be agreed with the Course Leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;associatedcareers&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Associated careers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Full-time students without a prior background in the air transport industry should be well placed on completion of the course to take up junior positions in planning, management and operational roles with airlines and airports. They will also be well equipped for employment as analysts with consultancies, government bodies and aircraft manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Students with a prior industry background should be able to return to their position with new skills and understanding, plus a greater maturity of approach. Graduates will be well placed to move into senior managerial, policy or research functions. The competitive nature of the industry will also provide many new opportunities for suitably qualified personnel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A strong performance on the MSc provides the opportunity to study further by registering for a research degree in the Department of Transport Studies. Graduates will also be equipped with the knowledge, understanding and skills needed to participate in the activities of professional bodies such as the Air Transport Research Society, the German Aviation Research Society and AirNeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;lengthofcourse&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Length of course&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One year full-time; two or three years part-time.

Applicants without these formal academic qualifications but with professional qualifications or substantial (normally at least over three years) relevant work experience in the air transport industry may be considered for the course.
